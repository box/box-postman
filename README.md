[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a tool that lets you build and test HTTP requests in an easy-to-use interface without configuring a full development environment. Our official Postman Collection allows you to quicly get started with the [Box APIs](https://developer.box.com/) in Postman.

## The Collections

### Classic Collection

A updated, up-to-date Postman Collection is created every few weeks based on
the official Box [OpenAPI 3.0 Specification][openapi].
