The following content is for Box employees only. If you are not a Box employee
you can skip this section.

## `Jira` & `Confluence`

There are a few internal sources that are of interest to Box employees.

* **`Jira`** - When working on this project, please open a **`DDOC`** `Jira`
  ticket. The developer relations team maintain this project and you can
  therefore open a **`DDOC`**  ticket to request their support.

## Branches & Pull Requests

When working on the API specification we recommend the following best practices:

* **Branches:** Please only work on a feature branch, as the `main` branch is
  protected. Please use a descriptive name for your branch that mentions both
  the `Jira` ticket this relates to, as well as a human description of the change.
  For example: `ddoc-123/fix-bug-in-responses`
* **Pull Requests:** When opening a Pull Request, please use the
  template to provide all the information needed.
  * Any **DDOC** `Jira` tickets that this change is related to
  * A description of the change made
* **Draft Pull Requests:** When working on a design change that has not yet been
  approved, we high recommend creating a **draft Pull Request**, as it won't be
  accidentally merged before the change is ready.
